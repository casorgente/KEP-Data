This repository contains the dataset used in the research paper _"Reconfigurable matchings and back-arcs recourse actions in kidney paired exchange programs"_ by C. Sorgente, D. Serra, M. Gentili, R. Cerulli.

## Description
The [compatibility](https://github.com/casorgente/KEP-Data/tree/main/compatibility) folder contains a set of instances generated by using the instance generator made available by Delorme et al. [[1]](#1), which relies on data from the UK Living Kidney Sharing Scheme (UKLKSS) for blood groups and cPRA distributions.
Such a set consists of 10 different compatibility graphs of 100 incompatible patient-donor pairs each, drawn according to the strategy described by Saidman et al. [[2]](#2).
For each compatibility graph, the [arrivals](https://github.com/casorgente/KEP-Data/tree/main/arrivals) folder contains 10 different files indicating different orders according to which pairs join the program.
